# Hangman

v0.1.2

This is a traditional "hangman" game in which you must try to guess the letters of a word before all of your allotted attempts are depleted.  Each wrong guess shall result in a line of the gallows being drawn.  If you fail to guess the word correctly, the stick figure meets his demise.  If you guess the word correctly, the stick figure goes home to his family.  All of the words to be guessed were curated by a humanities graduate from Penn State.  Enjoy!

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

1. You will need a modern web browser that can render HTML documents (e.g. Google Chrome).

2. Download and unzip the Hangman file to your system.

### Installing

This is a stand-alone web application that does not need to be installed. It will run locally on your computer upon executing the "index.html" file.

## Known Issues

* If a user clicks on the same wrong letter more than once, they lose an additional attempt instead of that already guessed word being "shut off"

## Testing

Did you break it?  Please [contact me](mailto:lfb11@alumni.psu.edu) and let me know what functionality is not working properly so that I can fix the code.
